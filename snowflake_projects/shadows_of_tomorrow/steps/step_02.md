# Step 2: Five-Sentence Structure

**Sentence 1 - Setup (Status Quo):**
Elena Voss runs an underground memory-recovery clinic in Neo-Shanghai, helping victims retrieve memories erased by corporate "cleanup" programs, while secretly investigating a series of unsolved murders linked to illegal neural modification.

**Sentence 2 - First Disaster (25% Mark):**
When Elena illegally cracks her own implant to boost her investigative abilities, she discovers fragmented memories of committing one of the murders she's been investigating, along with evidence that someone has been systematically editing her mind for the past three years.

**Sentence 3 - Second Disaster (50% Mark - Midpoint):**
Elena tracks down her own deleted memory backups and learns she was once a corporate assassin who volunteered for a witness protection mind-wipe, but the program failed, leaving her with two personalities—neither of which knows when the other will emerge.

**Sentence 4 - Third Disaster (75% Mark - All Is Lost):**
Her alternate personality resurfaces during a confrontation with her former handler, killing him and framing Elena's only ally for the murder, forcing Elena to choose between destroying the part of herself that's a killer or letting an innocent person die.

**Sentence 5 - Resolution (100% Mark):**
Elena integrates both personalities by accepting her past, uses her combined skills to expose the corrupt witness protection program, and creates a new identity that owns both sides of who she is—neither fully innocent nor irredeemable.

**Three Disasters Defined:**
1. **First Disaster**: Discovery of self-incriminating memories + realization of mind-editing
2. **Second Disaster**: Learning about dual personality + failed witness protection
3. **Third Disaster**: Alternate personality kills handler + ally framed
