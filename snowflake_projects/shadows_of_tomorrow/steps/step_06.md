# Four-Page Master Plan

## ACT 1: THE SETUP AND FIRST DISASTER (0-25%)

Elena Voss operates from a converted storage unit in Neo-Shanghai Lower City. The opening shows her with a client - a former corporate accountant whose memories of embezzlement evidence were wiped. Through skilled neural interface work, Elena recovers fragments proving corporate fraud. This establishes her expertise and moral mission. We learn she funds this work through gray-market memory tech sales.

Between client sessions, Elena maintains her murder investigation board. Five victims, all with modified implants, all ruled accidental. She has been mapping connections for eight months, obsessively collecting evidence police ignore. Her apartment is covered with photos, timelines, neural scan readouts. She suspects corporate hit squad but cannot prove it.

Marcus visits regularly, documenting her work for his underground news site. Their relationship shows genuine friendship and shared idealism. He pushes her to go public with the murder evidence; she insists on having airtight proof first. Their banter reveals Elena haunted by unnamed guilt she cannot explain - she helps others recover memories while her own past feels hollow.

The inciting incident arrives when Elena decides to hack her own implant. Marcus warns this is dangerous, but Elena needs enhanced pattern recognition to connect the murder cases. The procedure starts normally but quickly destabilizes. Pain, disorientation, then flood of memories: blood on hands, faces in terror, neural disruptor weight. Elena sees herself committing the murders through her own eyes.

She cross-references timestamps - the memories align perfectly with the crime scenes. Simultaneously, she discovers background software in her implant, running for three years, suppressing and editing memories. The first disaster is complete: Elena is investigating herself, and someone has been controlling her mind.

## ACT 2A: INVESTIGATION AND SECOND DISASTER (25-50%)

Elena spirals into paranoia and dissociation. She cannot trust her own memories or perceptions. Is Marcus real or implanted? Did she actually help clients or harm them? She begins recording herself constantly, sleeping with restraints, afraid of what unconscious-her might do. She pushes Marcus away, terrified she might hurt him.

Despite psychological collapse, investigator-Elena continues searching. She traces the editing software signature through dark web forums, finding whispers of classified corporate program. The trail leads to heavily encrypted servers. Elena plans a physical break-in to an archive facility, using skills she does not remember having but somehow possesses.

The heist sequence reveals Elena capabilities she cannot explain - advanced security bypassing, combat reflexes, tactical thinking. She moves through the facility like a trained operative, muscle memory taking over. She finds the servers and begins downloading files, discovering massive witness protection database.

Her own file appears: Asset Designation Wraith, real name classified, corporate eliminator for sensitive targets. Five years ago she witnessed executive corruption endangering millions. Offered deal: testify in exchange for revolutionary mind-wipe giving her new identity as Elena Voss. But the procedure created partition instead of replacement - two personalities in one body.

The download includes logs: Wraith has been surfacing during Elena blackout periods, continuing assassination work. The five murder victims were all connected to the corruption case she was supposed to testify about. Wraith has been systematically eliminating witnesses, believing the deal was betrayed. Second disaster complete: Elena is literally two people, and her other self is a methodical killer.

## ACT 2B: ATTEMPTED CONTROL AND THIRD DISASTER (50-75%)

Elena attempts to suppress Wraith through neural inhibitors, essentially drugging herself into semi-consciousness. This makes her safer but ineffective. Wraith still surfaces occasionally, leaving Elena with missing time and blood under her fingernails. Marcus discovers her drugged state and forces confrontation.

Elena finally reveals everything to Marcus - the dual personality, the murders, the witness protection failure. Marcus struggles between believing her and facing evidence. He researches dissociative identity disorders and corporate mind-crimes, trying to find solution that does not involve losing Elena.

Together they identify Director Kain as the program architect and Elena former handler. Marcus suggests they approach Kain for help - he created the problem, maybe he can fix it. Elena reluctantly agrees, hoping Kain has a way to permanently suppress Wraith without destroying Elena personality.

They arrange meeting at Kain secure office. Kain arrives defensive, admitting the program had complications but insisting Elena was success story. He offers to reinstall memory blocks, reset her to factory-fresh Elena Voss. But during negotiation, Elena feels familiar dissociation beginning.

She tries to fight it but Wraith surfaces fully, taking control while Elena remains conscious but paralyzed inside her own body. Wraith speaks: Kain tried to erase her, the ultimate betrayal. Kain reaches for panic button but Wraith is faster. Elena watches helplessly through her own eyes as Wraith kills Kain brutally, efficiently.

Kain security AI activates, scanning the scene. Wraith wipes the weapon and places it near unconscious Marcus (who Wraith knocked out when he tried to intervene). The AI uploads fabricated evidence to law enforcement: Marcus Chen murdered Director Kain. Police arrive within minutes, arresting Marcus. Elena regains control to find Kain dead and her only ally facing execution. Third disaster complete.

## ACT 3: CRISIS, CLIMAX, AND RESOLUTION (75-100%)

Elena finds a kill-code in Kain files - program designed to erase Wraith personality completely. But the code will also destroy her neural implant, causing severe cognitive damage, possibly erasing Elena too. She faces impossible choice: risk destroying herself to save Marcus, or let innocent person die.

She visits Marcus in custody. He tells her through security glass: do not sacrifice yourself for him. He knows she did not choose this. But Elena sees his execution date and knows she cannot live with more innocent deaths on her conscience. She prepares to run the kill-code.

Dr. Yuki Tanaka appears - revealed as former program developer who left out of guilt. She has been monitoring Elena, knowing the mind-wipe would eventually fail. Yuki admits she helped create Elena and has been hiding this truth. But now she offers alternative: forced integration instead of destruction.

The integration process means deliberately breaking the partition, experiencing all of Wraith memories simultaneously, accepting both personalities as one person. Yuki warns this could destroy Elena psyche completely - the trauma of remembering everything she did as Wraith might be unsurvivable. But it is only way to stop Wraith without erasing Elena.

Elena chooses integration. The procedure is agonizing - five years of suppressed memories flooding back at once. She remembers being Wraith: the training, the kills, the cold efficiency. She remembers the corruption she witnessed, the deal she made, the betrayal she felt when Kain tried to erase her. She remembers being Elena: the compassion, the guilt, the desire to help victims. The two identities clash, threatening to tear her apart.

But Elena holds on, forcing the personalities to merge rather than destroy each other. She emerges as unified person - someone who remembers being both assassin and healer, who owns both histories. She has Wraith tactical skills and Elena moral compass. She is more whole than she ever was as either personality alone.

With integrated abilities, Elena breaks Marcus out of custody using Wraith infiltration skills and Elena understanding of his loyalty. Together they gather all evidence of the failed witness protection program, documenting hundreds of cases like Elena - people with dissociative personalities created by botched mind-wipes.

Elena surrenders to authorities, but not before uploading everything to Marcus news network. The evidence brings down the executives responsible for both original corruption and the disastrous cover-up. The public exposure forces legal system to confront reality of corporate mind-crimes.

The novel ends with Elena testifying at her own trial, fully herself for the first time. She pleads guilty to the murders but provides context of the mind-wipe program. Marcus advocates from the outside for reformed sentencing laws recognizing corporate manipulation of identity. Elena faces consequences but with integrity intact - she chose accountability over escape, integration over denial. She is both the person who killed and the person who seeks justice, and she accepts responsibility for both.
