**Selected Hook:**

**Alternative Variations Considered:**

2. When Elena cracks her own neural implant, she discovers the person she's hunting for murder is herself. [SELECTED]
3. A black-market memory surgeon realizes her most dangerous patient is the woman she used to be before someone erased her.
4. To solve her sister's disappearance, a memory-thief must recover the one memory someone paid a fortune to delete: her own.
5. She built her career stealing memories from criminals, until she found one locked inside her own mind that someone will kill to protect.

**Core Elements:**
- Protagonist: Elena (memory-hacker/neural implant specialist)
- Conflict: Self-investigation, identity crisis
- Stakes: She may be a murderer; recovering truth could implicate herself
