# SCENE 1: Client Recovery Session

Elena's fingers hovered over the neural interface controls, steady despite the tremor she'd learned to ignore. Across from her in the converted storage unit that passed for her clinic, the client sat with his eyes closed, the implant port behind his ear glowing a soft amber. Marcus called this place a dump, but Elena preferred to think of it as discreet. The bare concrete walls kept signals contained, and the jury-rigged equipment worked well enough for what she did.

"I can feel it," the client said, voice tight. "It's there, but it hurts."

"That's the suppression breaking down." Elena kept her voice soft but precise, the tone that made clients trust her. "The pain means we're close. I need you to hold on for thirty more seconds."

The man's name was Chen Wei, a former corporate accountant whose memories of embezzlement evidence had been wiped after he'd tried to whistleblow. Standard corporate cleanup. They'd left him with enough functioning memory to maintain basic life skills, but took everything related to the fraud. Everything except the ghost of knowing he'd once known something important.

Elena adjusted the extraction parameters, watching the neural mapping screens. The memory wasn't gone, just buried under layers of suppression code. Like archeology, she'd told Chen during intake, except the ruins were in his head and the excavation could cause permanent damage.

"Twenty seconds." Her callused fingers moved across the controls with practiced ease. Years of this work had left her hands permanently marked - roughened skin, a small burn scar on her right thumb from a malfunctioning interface. Honest work, she told herself. Helping people reclaim what corporations stole.

The equipment hummed louder. Chen's breathing changed, quick and shallow. Elena monitored his vitals, ready to pull the plug if his heart rate spiked too high. The neon from the city outside bled through gaps in the improvised wall panels, casting everything in shades of pink and blue.

"Now," she said.

The extraction completed. On her screen, fragments of memory coalesced - spreadsheet cells, transaction codes, executive names, dates. Evidence. Enough to prove the fraud Chen had been silenced for reporting.

"I've got it," Elena said, saving the data to an encrypted drive. "The memories are yours again."

Chen opened his eyes - brown, wet with tears. "Thank you. Thank you so much, you don't know what it's like, not knowing what you know, feeling like there's a hole—"

"I know," Elena said, and immediately regretted it. The unnamed guilt that lived beneath her sternum stirred, as it always did during recoveries. She didn't know why she felt guilty. Her own past was unremarkable - ordinary childhood, ordinary adolescence, drift into underground tech work. Nothing to feel guilty about. And yet.

Chen left twenty minutes later, clutching the drive with evidence he could barely remember collecting. The money he'd transferred would fund Elena's work for another month. She locked the door behind him and stood alone in the humming quiet of her clinic.

She should shut down the equipment. She should go home, maybe call Marcus, maybe eat something. Instead, Elena found herself staring at the neural interface chair where Chen had sat, still warm from his body.

The equipment was already configured. It would take thirty seconds to redirect the extraction protocols. Another forty-five to bypass the safety limits that prevented self-operation. She'd sworn she'd never do this - looking into her own mind was dangerous, potentially catastrophic. But lately the unnamed guilt had been growing stronger, and beneath it, something else. A sense of wrongness. Of missing time she couldn't account for. Of skills she shouldn't have.

And there was her other obsession: the investigation board in her apartment, five victims with modified neural implants, all ruled accidental deaths, all connected by a pattern she couldn't quite see. If she could just enhance her pattern recognition capabilities, push her brain into overdrive for a few hours...

Elena's hand drifted to the implant port behind her right ear, touching it the way she always did when stressed. The metal was warm against her fingertips.

Not tonight, she told herself. Too risky.

But as she reached to shut down the equipment, something made her pause. A flicker at the edge of the extraction screen, visible for just a fraction of a second during Chen's recovery. She'd seen something. Not his memory. Someone else's.

Her own.

Blood on hands. Face contorted in terror. The weight of something metallic and deadly.

Elena's heart hammered. She replayed the session log, isolating the moment. There - a fragment of memory that didn't belong to Chen, bleeding through from the operator. From her.

Her hands shook as she froze the image. The hands in the memory were definitely hers - same small scar on the right thumb, same calluses. But the blood was someone else's. And the face in the memory, twisted in fear, was staring up at her with dying eyes.

Elena stumbled back from the console, dark brown eyes wide in the neon-lit dimness. She looked down at her own hands, clean and empty. Looked back at the screen. The fragment was still there, impossible to deny.

The equipment hummed in the background, waiting for her decision.

"What did I see?" she whispered to the empty room.

No answer came except the distant sound of the city and the guilty certainty that had lived in her chest for three years, now screaming that she was about to learn why.

Elena sat back down in the interface chair, fingers already moving toward the controls. If there were ghosts in her head, she needed to know. She needed to see.

Even if it destroyed her to look.
