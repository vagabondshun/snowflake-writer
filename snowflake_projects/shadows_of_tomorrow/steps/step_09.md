# Scene Architecture - Internal Structure Design

## SCENE 1: Client Recovery Session
**Type**: PROACTIVE (Goal-Conflict-Disaster)
**POV**: Elena Voss
**Word Target**: 1,200-1,500 words

### Opening Hook
Elena fingers hover over neural interface controls. Client across from her, eyes closed, implant port glowing. Opening line establishes her expertise and the stakes.

### Scene Goal
Elena aims to recover corporate embezzlement evidence from client memory, proving her skills and establishing the underground clinic.

### Conflict
Client body language shows fear. Memories are painful. Each recovered fragment causes physical distress. Elena must balance extraction speed with client safety.

### Sensory Details
- **Visual**: Converted storage unit, bare walls, jury-rigged neural equipment, neon bleeding through gaps
- **Audio**: Equipment hum, client breathing changes, distant city noise
- **Tactile**: Elena steady hands on controls, client trembling
- **Emotional**: Elena focus, unnamed guilt beneath surface, client terror-hope mix

### Character Emotional State
- **Entry**: Elena professional and focused, suppressing unnamed guilt
- **Exit**: Elena satisfied with success but disturbed by her own memory fragments

### Disaster
During recovery, Elena glimpses her own fragmented memories bleeding through the connection - blood on hands, face in terror. She pulls back before client notices.

### Closing Hook
Client leaves grateful. Elena alone stares at her hands, wondering what she just saw. Sets up her decision to hack her own implant.

### Consistency Check (Character Bible)
- ✓ Elena: Dark brown eyes, soft precise speech, touches implant port when stressed
- ✓ Callused fingers from interface work referenced
- ✓ Unnamed guilt established

## SCENE 3: The Implant Hack (First Disaster)
**Type**: PROACTIVE (Goal-Conflict-Disaster)
**POV**: Elena Voss
**Word Target**: 1,800-2,000 words (major turning point)

### Opening Hook
Elena alone in her clinic after midnight. Equipment jury-rigged for self-hack. Mirror positioned so she can see her own eyes. She knows this is dangerous.

### Scene Goal
Hack her own implant to get enhanced pattern recognition, connect the murder cases, prove the corporate conspiracy.

### Conflict
Safety protocols scream warnings. Each limiter she bypasses increases risk of brain damage. Pain escalating. She has to choose how far to push.

### Sensory Details
- **Visual**: Her own face in mirror, implant port glowing hot, screens showing neural maps, city lights through window
- **Audio**: Equipment whine rising in pitch, her own breathing ragged, warning beeps
- **Tactile**: Searing pain behind right ear, hands gripping chair arms, cold sweat
- **Smell**: Ozone from overheating equipment, her own fear-sweat
- **Taste**: Copper blood from biting lip
- **Emotional**: Determination fighting terror, obsession overriding survival instinct

### Character Emotional State
- **Entry**: Determined but apprehensive, driven by obsession to solve murders
- **Midpoint**: Pain and fear, second-guessing, but too far in to stop
- **Exit**: Horrified and paranoid, world shattered

### Proactive Scene Structure
**GOAL**: Enhance pattern recognition to connect murder cases
**CONFLICT**: Each safety override increases brain damage risk
**DISASTER**: Instead of enhancement, unlocks suppressed memories of her committing the murders

### The Disaster Sequence (Moment by Moment)
1. Final limiter bypassed - equipment screams - pain spikes
2. Flood of data but wrong kind - not enhanced cognition but memories
3. First image: Blood on her hands (her perspective, her hands)
4. Second image: Face contorted in terror (victim seeing her)
5. Third image: Neural disruptor in her grip, finger on trigger
6. Fourth image: Body falling, her checking pulse professionally
7. Overlays timestamps - realizes what she's seeing
8. Cross-references murder investigation files - timestamps match perfectly
9. Discovers background software - memory editing active for 3 years
10. Equipment shuts down - Elena in darkness except city lights
11. Looks at her hands in dim light - are they killer hands?
12. First dissociative moment - which memories are real?

### Closing Hook
Elena stares at her investigation board. The five victim photos stare back. She killed them. All of them. But she doesn't remember. And someone has been editing her memories to keep it hidden. Who is she?

### Consistency Check (Character Bible)
- ✓ Elena: Dark brown eyes reflected in mirror
- ✓ Black hair in ponytail (practical for procedure)
- ✓ Touches implant port repeatedly during procedure
- ✓ Speaks aloud to herself - soft precise words, technical jargon
- ✓ Callused fingers operating controls
- ✓ Left hand starts trembling (foreshadowing Wraith surfacing later)
- ✓ Compulsive recording starts after this scene

### Critical Sensory Moments
1. **The pain**: "Searing behind her right ear, like someone driving heated needles through the port into her brain"
2. **The memory flood**: "Images slamming through her consciousness, not hers but undeniably from her eyes"
3. **The blood**: "Dark and wet on her hands, still warm, and she could feel its texture"
4. **The recognition**: "The timestamp overlays on the memory matched her investigation board exactly"
5. **The software**: "Three years. Someone had been editing her mind for three years."

## SCENE 9: Marcus Forced Confrontation
**Type**: REACTIVE (Reaction-Dilemma-Decision)
**POV**: Marcus Chen
**Word Target**: 1,200-1,500 words

### Opening Hook
Marcus breaks into Elena clinic. She won't answer calls for three days. Finds her surrounded by recording equipment, sleeping in restraints, apartment covered in paranoid notes.

### Scene Structure (Reactive)
**REACTION**: Horror and concern at seeing Elena paranoid state
**DILEMMA**: Demand truth and risk pushing her away, or give her space and watch her spiral
**DECISION**: Demands truth, refuses to leave until she explains

### Sensory Details
- **Visual**: Marcus perspective - Elena apartment transformed into paranoid fortress, recording cameras everywhere, restraints, food untouched
- **Audio**: Elena voice hoarse from not speaking, recording equipment running constantly
- **Emotional**: Marcus fear for her, Elena defensive hostility

### Character Emotional State
- **Marcus Entry**: Worried and determined, prepared for confrontation
- **Marcus Exit**: Shaken but more committed, realizes depth of situation
- **Elena Entry**: Defensive and paranoid, does not trust even Marcus
- **Elena Exit**: Slightly softened but still won't fully explain

### Consistency Check
- ✓ Marcus: Brown eyes behind glasses, messy hair, adjusts glasses nervously when confronting Elena
- ✓ Fast-talker when emotional: "Elena, look at me, please, just look at me, you're scaring me, whatever this is we can handle it together"
- ✓ Compulsive note-taking even in crisis
- ✓ Elena: Won't make eye contact, touches implant port repeatedly, left hand tremor visible

### Closing Hook
Elena gives partial truth - admits finding disturbing memories. Doesn't reveal they're murder memories. Marcus insists on helping. Elena refuses but doesn't push him away completely. Marcus leaves determined to investigate her himself.

## ARCHITECTURE NOTES

**Proactive Scene Pattern** (35 scenes):
- Goal (character wants something specific)
- Conflict (obstacles to achieving goal)
- Disaster (fails to achieve goal, situation worsens)

**Reactive Scene Pattern** (25 scenes):
- Reaction (emotional processing of previous disaster)
- Dilemma (considering options, all bad)
- Decision (choosing next course of action)

**Alternation**: Proactive and reactive scenes should alternate to maintain pacing. After high-action disaster scene, give reader and character breathing room with reactive scene.

**Sensory Checklist** for Each Scene:
- Visual (what POV character sees)
- Audio (what they hear)
- Tactile (what they feel/touch)
- Emotional (what they're feeling)
- POV-specific details (their unique perspective)

**Character Consistency**:
- Before drafting ANY scene, reference Character Bible for POV character
- Verify: eye color, physical mannerisms, speech patterns, emotional baseline
- Flag contradictions immediately

**Opening/Closing Hooks**:
- Every scene starts mid-action or with immediate tension
- Every scene ends on question, decision, or revelation
- No scenes end with complete resolution (except final scene)

**Word Count Targets**:
- Standard scene: 1,200-1,500 words
- Major turning point: 1,800-2,000 words
- Quiet character moment: 800-1,000 words
- Climactic scene: 2,000-2,500 words
